<br />
<b>5.3 Pricing.</b>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<b>5.3.1 Providing Your List Price.</b>&nbsp;The list price you provide to us is referred to in this Agreement as your &quot;List Price.&quot; For some marketplaces, you will provide us a List Price inclusive of value added or similar taxes that are included within the customer purchase price of a product (&ldquo;VAT&rdquo;).&nbsp;<b>Where your Royalty is calculated based on your List Price, it will be calculated based on your List Price exclusive of the VAT applicable to the customer.</b>&nbsp;You may change your List Price through the 1Book website, and your change will be effective within 5 business days. The&nbsp;<a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/self-publishing/help?topicId=A29FL26OKE7R7B" target="_blank">Pricing Page</a>&nbsp;may have additional requirements for List Prices that you must comply with.&nbsp;<br />

<br />
<b>5.3.2 Customer Prices.</b>&nbsp;To the extent not prohibited by applicable laws, we have sole and complete discretion to set the retail customer price at which your Digital Books are sold through the Program. We are solely responsible for processing payments, payment collection, requests for refunds and related customer service, and will have sole ownership and control of all data obtained from customers and prospective customers in connection with the Program.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<b>5.4 Royalties and Payments.</b>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<b>5.4.1 Royalties.</b>&nbsp;If you are not in breach of your obligations under this Agreement, for each Digital Book sold to a customer through the Program, the 1Book party that made the sale (or whose affiliate made the sale) will pay you the applicable Royalty set forth in the&nbsp;<u>Pricing Page</u>, net of refunds, bad debt, and any VAT, sales or other taxes charged to a customer or applied with respect to sales to a customer.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<b>5.4.2 When We Pay You.</b>&nbsp;1Book will pay Royalties due on Digital Book sales approximately 10 days following the end of the calendar month during which the sales were made. At the time of payment, we will make available to you an online report detailing sales of Digital Books and corresponding Royalties.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<b>5.4.3 Payment Currencies.</b>&nbsp;Your payment currency will be in INR.<br />
<br />
<b>5.4.4 Payment Policies.</b>&nbsp;We may require you to provide certain information or to register a valid bank account in your 1Book account in order to receive Royalty payments, in which case we will not be obligated to make Royalty payments to you unless you do so. We may establish other payment policies from time to time, such as minimum payment amounts for different payment methods and check fees.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<b>5.4.5 Payment Disputes.</b>&nbsp;You may not bring a suit or other legal proceeding against us with regard to any statement unless you bring it within six months after the date the statement is available. Any such proceeding will be limited to a determination of the amount of monies, if any, payable by us to you for the accounting periods in question, and your sole remedy will be the recovery of those monies with no interest.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<b>5.4.6 Offsets, etc.</b>&nbsp;We can withhold Royalties and offset them against future payments as indicated below. Our exercise of these rights does not limit other rights we may have to withhold or offset Royalties or exercise other remedies.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>&bull; If we pay you a Royalty on a sale and later issue a refund, return, or credit for that sale, we may offset the amount of the Royalty previously paid for the sale against future Royalties, or require you to remit that amount to us.&nbsp;<br />
&bull; If a third party asserts that you did not have all rights required to make one of your Digital Books available through the Program, we may hold all Royalties due to you until we reasonably determine the validity of the third party claim. If we determine that you did not have all of those rights or that you have otherwise breached your representations and warranties or our&nbsp;<a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/self-publishing/help?topicId=A2TOZW0SV7IR1U" target="_blank">Content Guidelines</a>&nbsp;(Refer Terms of Use) with regard to a Digital Book, we will not owe you Royalties for that Digital Book and we may offset any of those Royalties that were previously paid against future Royalties, or require you to remit them to us.&nbsp;<br />
&bull; Upon termination of this Agreement, we may withhold all Royalties due for a period of three months from the date they would otherwise be payable in order to ensure our ability to off-set any refunds or other offsets we are entitled to take against the Royalties.&nbsp;<br />
&bull; If we terminate this Agreement because you have breached your representations and warranties or our&nbsp;<a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/self-publishing/help?topicId=A2TOZW0SV7IR1U" target="_blank">Content Guidelines</a>(Refer Terms of Use), you forfeit all Royalties not yet paid to you. If after we have terminated your account you open a new account without our express permission, we will not owe you any Royalties through the new account.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>
<b>5.4.7 Taxes.</b>&nbsp;1Book is responsible for collecting and remitting any and all taxes imposed on their respective sales of Digital Books to customers. You are responsible for any income or other taxes due and payable resulting from payments to you by the 1Book under this Agreement. Accordingly, unless otherwise stated, the amounts due to you hereunder are inclusive of any taxes that may apply to such payments. The 1Book maintain the right, however, to deduct or withhold any and all applicable taxes from amounts due by them to you, and the amounts due, as reduced by those deductions or withholdings, will constitute full payment and settlement to you.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<b>5.5 Grant of Rights.</b>&nbsp;You grant to 1Book, throughout the term of this Agreement, a nonexclusive, irrevocable, right and license to distribute Digital Books, directly and through third-party distributors, in all digital formats by all digital distribution means available. This right includes, without limitation, the right to: (a) reproduce, index and store Digital Books on one or more computer facilities, and reformat, convert and encode Digital Books; (b) display, market, transmit, distribute, sell and otherwise digitally make available all or any portion of Digital Books through 1Book Properties, for customers and prospective customers to download, access, copy and paste, print, annotate and/or view online and offline, including on portable devices; (c) permit customers to &quot;store&quot; Digital Books that they have purchased from us on servers (&quot;Virtual Storage&quot;) and to access and re-download such Digital Books from Virtual Storage from time to time both during and after the term of this Agreement; (d) display and distribute (i) your trademarks and logos in the form you provide them to us or within Digital Books (with such modifications as are necessary to optimize their viewing), and (ii) portions of Digital Books, in each case solely for the purposes of marketing, soliciting and selling Digital Books and related 1Book offerings; (e) use, reproduce, adapt, modify, and distribute, as we determine appropriate, in our sole discretion, any metadata that you provide in connection with Digital Books; and (f) transmit, reproduce and otherwise use (or cause the reformatting, transmission, reproduction, and/or other use of) Digital Books as mere technological incidents to and for the limited purpose of technically enabling the foregoing (e.g., caching to enable display). In addition, you agree that we may permit our affiliates and independent contractors, and our affiliates' independent contractors, to exercise the rights that you grant to us in this Agreement. &quot;1Book Properties&quot; means any web site, application or online point of presence, on any platform, that is owned or operated by or under license by 1Book or co-branded with 1Book, and any web site, application, device or online point of presence through which any 1Book Properties or products available for sale on them are syndicated, offered, merchandised, advertised or described. You grant us the rights set forth in this Section 5.5 on a worldwide basis; however, if we make available to you a procedure for indicating that you do not have worldwide distribution rights to a Digital Book, then the territory for the sale of that Digital Book will be those territories for which you indicate, through the procedure we provide to you, that you have distribution rights.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<b>5.6 DRM and Geo-filtering Technology.</b>&nbsp;We may, but are not obligated, to provide you the option to apply DRM technology in connection with the distribution of your Digital Books. If we provide you the option to apply DRM technology, you acknowledge that we make no representations as to the efficacy of the DRM and will not be responsible for any failure of the DRM. We also may, but are not obligated, to use geo-filtering technology as a way of determining which customers are entitled to purchase Digital Books, for example, where you indicate that you do not have worldwide distribution rights to a Digital Book through the procedure we provide to you for that purpose. If we use geo-filtering technology when distributing your Digital Books, distribution will be deemed to have taken place within the permitted distribution territories for the Digital Books, even though customers may, in fact, be located outside those territories.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<b>5.7 Rights Clearances and Rights Dispute Resolution.</b>&nbsp;You will obtain and pay for any and all necessary clearances and licenses for the Digital Books to permit our exercise of the rights granted under this Agreement without any further payment obligation by us, including, without limitation, all royalties and other income due to any copyright owner. If you notify us through the procedure we provide on the applicable 1Book Property for making claims of copyright infringement that a third party has made a Digital Book available for distribution through the Program (or for distribution in a particular territory through the Program) that you have the exclusive right to make available under the Program, then, upon your request and after verification of your claim, we will pay you the Royalties due in connection with any sales of the Digital Book through the Program, and will remove the Digital Book from future sale through the Program, as your sole and exclusive remedy.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<b>5.8 Representations, Warranties and Indemnities.</b>&nbsp;You represent and warrant that: (a) you have the full right, power and authority to enter into and fully perform this Agreement and will comply with the terms of this Agreement; (b) prior to you or your designee's delivery of any content, you will have obtained all rights that are necessary for the exercise the rights granted under this Agreement; (c) neither the exercise of the rights authorized under this Agreement nor any materials embodied in the content nor its sale or distribution as authorized in this Agreement will violate or infringe upon the intellectual property, proprietary or other rights of any person or entity, including, without limitation, contractual rights, copyrights, trademarks, common law rights, rights of publicity, or privacy, or moral rights, or contain defamatory material or violate any laws or regulations of any jurisdiction; (d) you will ensure that all Digital Books delivered under the Program comply with the technical delivery specifications provided by us; and (e) you will be solely responsible for accounting and paying any co-owners or co-administrators of any Digital Book or portion thereof any royalties with respect to the uses of the content and their respective shares, if any, of any monies payable under this Agreement. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you will indemnify, defend and hold 1Book, its officers, directors, employees, affiliates, subcontractors and assigns harmless from and against any loss, claim, liability, damage, action or cause of action (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that arises from any breach of your representations, warranties or obligations set forth in this Agreement. We will be entitled, at our expense, to participate in the defence and settlement of the claim or action with counsel of our own choosing.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<b>6 Ownership and Control of 1Book Properties/ Feedback.</b>&nbsp;Subject to the authorizations you grant to us under this Agreement, as between us and you, you retain all ownership rights in and to the copyrights and all other rights and interest in and to your Digital Books. We retain all ownership rights in and to the copyrights and all other rights and interests in and to the Program, the 1Bok Properties, and any materials we use or provide to you for use relating to your Digital Book (such as a generic cover image used for your Digital Book if you do not provide one). We are solely responsible for, and will have full discretion with respect to the terms, features, and operation of the Program and the 1Book Properties and related marketing, but our use of the Digital Books will be subject to the terms of this Agreement. In the event that you elect to provide suggestions, ideas, or other feedback to 1Book or any of its affiliates in connection with the 1Book Properties or the Program (&quot;Feedback&quot;), 1Book and its affiliates will be free to use and exploit the same in any manner without restriction and without any need to compensate you. This Agreement does not grant you any license or other rights to any intellectual property or technology owned or operated by us or any of our affiliates, including, without limitation, any trademarks or trade names. Nothing in this Agreement restricts any rights we may have under applicable law or a separate permission.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<b>7 Confidentiality.</b>&nbsp;You will not, without our express, prior written permission: (a) issue any press release or make any other public disclosures regarding this Agreement or its terms; (b) disclose 1Book Confidential Information (as defined below) to any third party or to any employee other than an employee who needs to know the information; or (c) use 1Book Confidential Information for any purpose other than the performance of this Agreement. You may however disclose 1Book Confidential Information as required to comply with applicable law, provided you: (i) give us prior written notice sufficient to allow us to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy; (ii) disclose only that 1Book Confidential Information as is required by applicable law; and (iii) use reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment for any 1Book Confidential Information so disclosed. &quot;1Book Confidential Information&quot; means (1) any information regarding 1Book, its affiliates, and their businesses, including, without limitation, information relating to our technology, customers, business plans, promotional and marketing activities, finances and other business affairs, (2) the nature, content and existence of any communications between you and us, and (3) any sales data relating to the sale of Digital Books or other information we provide or make available to you in connection with the Program. 1Book Confidential Information does not include information that (A) is or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement, (B) you can show by documentation to have been known to you at the time you receive it from us, (C) you receive from a third party who did not acquire or disclose such information by a wrongful or tortious act, or (D) you can show by documentation that you have independently developed without reference to any 1Book Confidential Information. Without limiting the survivability of any other provision of this Agreement, this Section 7 will survive three years following the termination of this Agreement.&nbsp;<br />
<br />

<br />
<b>10.2 Other Legal provisions.</b>&nbsp;This Agreement may not be amended, except in writing signed by both parties or as provided in Section 2 above. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid by a court or other tribunal with jurisdiction over the parties to this Agreement, that provision will be deemed to be restated to reflect as nearly as possible the original intentions of the parties in accordance with applicable law, and the remainder of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors. Each party will bear its own costs and expenses in performing this Agreement. The failure of either party to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of the party's rights to subsequently enforce the provision.
